  * It combines dynamic record information such as topics, partitions, and batch size with static producer metadata
  * captured from the bound Kafka producer. It customizes send-span setup only; producer instrumentation independently
  * determines the span kind, record-context links, and whether batch records need dedicated `create` spans.
